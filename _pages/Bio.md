I just graduated from the University of Tübingen with a MSc degree. I majored in Neural Information Processing at <a href='https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/'>Graduate Training Center of Neuroscience</a>. <b>I'm looking for a phD position. </b>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently doing an intership at <a href='https://brain.mpg.de/laurent'>Prof. Gilles Laurent's lab</a> in Frankfurt. Meanwhile I also have a cognitive science project at <a href='https://hmc-lab.com/'>Human and Machine Cognition Lab</a> in Tübingen and a computational modeling project with <a href='https://www.vivekhsridhar.com/'>Dr. Vivek Sridhar</a> in Konstanz. I did my my master's thesis at <a href='https://www.burgalossilab.com/'>Burgalossi lab</a>, and my lab rotation at <a href='https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/'>Dr. Anna Levina's lab</a>. Before coming to Tübingen, I worked on diffusion MRI and received a master’s degree in psychology from <a href='https://english.bnu.edu.cn/'>Beijing Normal University</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in learning and memory, from a perspective of computational cognitive neuroscience. Besides, I like writing popular science blogs, have written some articles in chinese journal. I am the creator and core developer of open-source visualization project <a href='http://ccmapping.org/'>CCmapping</a>, which provides a populational-based online interactive atlas of human brain callosal connectivity.

I enjoy running, reading, cooking, and playing puzzles in my free time (if there is such a thing). Fun fact about me: I found the left side of my cerebellum is almost missing during the pilot scan of my first experiment. Ever since that, this has been the best excuse of my poor dancing skill. I've made a <a href='https://afurrybear.com/assets/img/yirong-brain-slice.jpeg'>Valentine's day poster of my brain slice</a>.
