I'm currently doing an intership at <a href='https://brain.mpg.de/laurent'>Prof. Gilles Laurent's lab</a> in Frankfurt and I'm about to start my graduate study in <a href='https://xdbio.jhmi.edu/'>XDBio program</a> at Johns Hopkins University and Janelia Research Campus. 
<br/>
<br/>
During my Master's study at University of Tübingen, I majored in Neural Information Processing at <a href='https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/'>Graduate Training Center of Neuroscience</a>. 
I worked in <a href='https://hmc-lab.com/'>Human and Machine Cognition Lab</a> and studied how attention modulates learning and memory. Meanwhile I studied dynamical systems in spatial decision making with <a href='https://www.vivekhsridhar.com/'>Dr. Vivek Sridhar</a> in Konstanz. I did my master's thesis in <a href='https://www.burgalossilab.com/'>Burgalossi lab</a>, and my lab rotation in <a href='https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/'>Dr. Anna Levina's lab</a>. Before my study in Tübingen, I studied at <a href='https://english.bnu.edu.cn/'>Beijing Normal University</a> and worked on corpus callosum topography using diffusion MRI (<a href='http://ccmapping.org/'>CCmapping</a>). 
<br/>
<br/>
My current research interests are learning and memory, especially in the context of spatial navigation. When I am not in lab, I enjoy writing popular science blogs. Besides, I love running, reading, cooking, and playing puzzles in my free time.

Fun fact about me: in the pilot scan of my experiment, I found the my left cerebellum is almost missing. Ever since that, this has been the best excuse of my poor dancing skill. I've made a <a href='https://afurrybear.com/assets/img/yirong-brain-slice.jpeg'>Valentine's day poster of my brain scan</a>.
